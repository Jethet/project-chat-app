## Project The Unexpected Chat

This app is built for mobile, with HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript. Special features are the spinner while the Chatbuddy is thinking, resulting in a unexpected reply.

The goal of the app is to stimulate conversation. When you are bored or lonely, and need someone (something?) to talk to, you can chat for hours.

The app is deployed on Netlify: [*The Unexpected Chat*](https://jethet-unexpected-chat-app.netlify.app/)

## Project The Unexpected Chat

This app is built for mobile, with HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript. Its goal is to stimulate conversation.

When you are bored and need someone (something?) to talk to, you can chat for hours.

The app is deployed on Netlify: [*The Unexpected Chat*](https://jethet-unexpected-chat-app.netlify.app/)
